428372026487615488,2014-01-29 03:40:24,I would rather be water boarded than have to listen to more of this speech.  Good night my friends.  There's just so much I can take.
428370641285152768,2014-01-29 03:34:54,Whoever picked this woman should be impeached.
428370351823675392,2014-01-29 03:33:45,This is worse than even I thought.  You think anybody is buying this?
428370118997839873,2014-01-29 03:32:49,Like I said … response to State of the Union is a big mistake.  This too is painful.
428369139862757377,2014-01-29 03:28:56,GOP response upcoming.  Big mistake in my view.  Opposition speech often comes off as cheesy compared to POTUS in Congress.
428364752239095808,2014-01-29 03:11:30,"OK class, what grade do you give this speech?"
428363612407595008,2014-01-29 03:06:58,Did he just say he's going to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay?  Didn't I hear that 5 years ago? Prediction:  not going to happen in 2014
428361256798396416,2014-01-29 02:57:36,This is insane.  Has he heard about the millions who have lost their health plans thanks to ObamaCare?  And their doctors?
428360752571752448,2014-01-29 02:55:36,"OK, I'm done:  He's bragging about ObamaCare …with all due respect, he's DELUSIONAL"
428358705965305857,2014-01-29 02:47:28,This thing about how women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns is just plain FACTUALLY wrong.  Nothing but pandering to women.
428357393487896576,2014-01-29 02:42:15,If you could bottle this speech you'd have a cure for insomnia
428357205096538112,2014-01-29 02:41:30,Dear Friends:  I'm fading fast.  This is panful.
