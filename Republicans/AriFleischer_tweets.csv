644348292151820288,2015-09-17 03:12:58,Good close by Kasich and a good close by Christie too.   Christie's weakness was that it's all about him. He must show it's about the voters
644347545175621632,2015-09-17 03:10:00,Strong close by Fiorina.
644347177280634880,2015-09-17 03:08:33,Very strong close by Bush.
644345013594386432,2015-09-17 02:59:57,I can't believe it.  Trump is humanizing himself.  Good line on Humble. Dumb question though.  (My USSS code name was Matrix.)

644332579450175492,2015-09-17 02:10:32,I don't think CNN has called on Walker for at least 30 minutes.

644325501683793920,2015-09-17 01:42:25,This tax debate is good.  A new tax code that promotes growth needs to be enacted.  This is what debates should be about.
644325163589308416,2015-09-17 01:41:04,Carson's story about growth is great.  That's what the GOP wants to hear - and believes in.

644323322331840512,2015-09-17 01:33:45,Fiorina needs to look at Trump when she takes him on. Don't look away.
644321892720099328,2015-09-17 01:28:04,Walker needs to interrupt and get back into this debate. He can't afford a mid-level night.
644321073748701184,2015-09-17 01:24:49,Rubio shows depth and knowledge on immigration.  I'm glad Jake didn't interrupt him.
644320342559866880,2015-09-17 01:21:55,Where's Hugh Hewitt?  Let him ask questions.

644319531251462144,2015-09-17 01:18:41,Jeb finally took Trump on and his call for an apology was smart.
644317821409882116,2015-09-17 01:11:54,Jeb should have turned it around and gone on offense about the things Trump has said.  That exchange hurt Jeb.
644317581705388032,2015-09-17 01:10:56,Jeb's exchange with Trump shows Jeb's problem.  Trump badgered him about why did you say it and Bush didn't have an answer.
644317060835708928,2015-09-17 01:08:52,Carly Fiorina is winning right now.
644316969953558529,2015-09-17 01:08:31,Trump's response to Fiorina was weak and pandering.  Not smart.  Fiorina's line obviously resonated with women.
644315345361215489,2015-09-17 01:02:03,Fiorina is channeling Margaret Thatcher.
644313574932938753,2015-09-17 00:55:01,Huckabee is making really good points about faith.
644313061654925314,2015-09-17 00:52:59,Cruz is now making points about Iran that Rubio should have been making. Strong statements by Cruz.
644312842871676929,2015-09-17 00:52:07,Kasich's softer approach on Iran is not going to resonate win GOP primary voters.
644312024290324481,2015-09-17 00:48:51,Beautiful takedown of Pres. Obama by Rubio on the Syrian red line.
644310856965226496,2015-09-17 00:44:13,Walker is also looking at the camera.  Stop doing that.
644310482661339140,2015-09-17 00:42:44,Kasich said IF Iran arms Hamas and Hezbollah.  They ARE arming them.  There is no if.
644309911522963456,2015-09-17 00:40:28,Ted shouldn't look directly into the camera.  He's not addressing the nation. He's in a room talking to other people.
644309593162686464,2015-09-17 00:39:12,Fiorina shows she knows her stuff.
644308064733147136,2015-09-17 00:33:07,Where's Rubio?  Jake needs to call on him.
644307740882505728,2015-09-17 00:31:50,Smart interjection by Fiorina.  Good points made.
644307512716591105,2015-09-17 00:30:56,Carson's slow and quiet demeanor will set him apart as others make a lot of noise.  The question is does he come across as too sleepy.
644307069542232064,2015-09-17 00:29:10,The truth is the GOP has a lot of successful governors on the stage who have accomplished major reforms.

644306775173394432,2015-09-17 00:28:00,Score one point for Kasich.  The tenor of this debate that Jake is creating is not what people want.
644306414903685120,2015-09-17 00:26:34,Trump's attack on Rand Paul's looks IS junior high school. He didn't need to do that.

644303051944292352,2015-09-17 00:13:12,"Huckabee: Wit and humor can be his strength.  Like Paul, he needs to rally his base."
644302836117975040,2015-09-17 00:12:21,Paul: He's on life support.  He needs to rally his libertarian base. Stand out by showing his unique stands.
644302642823450624,2015-09-17 00:11:35,Cruz: His lane is clogged.  Look for a way to win a point against Trump and Carson.
644302277440892930,2015-09-17 00:10:08,"Christie: Make people laugh. Everyone knows he can fight, but show humor - and clash with Trump."
644302108913704960,2015-09-17 00:09:27,"Kasich: Think NH. His appeal is to the Granite State, not Iowa. Remain inclusive and show why the GOP is a big tent."

644301716922437633,2015-09-17 00:07:54,Walker:  Show the conviction and passion he has for federal reform policy just like he showed passion when he fought for reform in WI.
644301337656754177,2015-09-17 00:06:24,Bush: Win a round with Trump using a clever line. Show voters he has fire.

644136779747065856,2015-09-16 13:12:30,History shows GOP primaries come down to a 1:1 clash between an establishment conservative and an insurgent. Insurgents have not yet won.

644135212457312256,2015-09-16 13:06:16,The other key dynamic to watch is drop-outs. The field needs to thin out. The early debate will fade in viewership and candidates will quit.
