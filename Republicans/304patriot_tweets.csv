10804786164,2010-03-21 03:51:17,@Bill1phd I  just have always preferred to use Constitutional Republic.

10804661696,2010-03-21 03:47:56,@Bill1phd They aren't as different as people think.  They both are about controlling the country.
10804649455,2010-03-21 03:47:36,@Bill1phd  Yes and Obama has and will continue on the same path
10804635375,2010-03-21 03:47:13,@Bill1phd I like republic over democracy.  Republic because citizens elect representatives

10804508255,2010-03-21 03:43:47,@Bill1phd I agree a Constitutional Republic is the best form.  We've just lost our way and strayed from the Constitution.

10804242642,2010-03-21 03:36:40,@Bill1phd I believe most politicians in DC have become corrupt.  Dems and Repubs alike.  This isn't about healthcare

2160347554,2009-06-14 01:49:17,@ivanrich I'm saying that pretty much every politician in office is corrupt. That this government isn't run according to the Constitution.
2160332129,2009-06-14 01:47:33,@ivanrich Ironic how every Lib I've talked to keeps bringing up Bush.  I haven't even mentioned Bushs' name to you.  I was no fan of his.
2160290987,2009-06-14 01:43:04,@twinelm After me not calling him names and asking for a solution he couldn't provide for 10 mins he gave up.
2160282730,2009-06-14 01:42:10,@twinelm I'm trying to stay positive.  I saw your conversation with Kailua there.  He was ragging me earlier but provides no solutions.

2160233675,2009-06-14 01:36:50,@KailuaSurf That includes Obama...he's just as corrupt as the next person in there.
2160227071,2009-06-14 01:36:05,@KailuaSurf Did you not read?  I said remove ALL Politicans.  Dem and Rep.  Too much corruption for power and money.
