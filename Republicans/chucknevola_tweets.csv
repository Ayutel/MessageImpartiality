644340426330255360,2015-09-17 02:41:43,Christy may have avoided the gallows from his performance tonight but only for now. #cnndebate
644339873395122176,2015-09-17 02:39:31,I think Rubio is John Kennedy in 1956. He needed to wait until 1960 to get in strong. Bush sounding presidential. Fiorina for chief logician
644337787794259969,2015-09-17 02:31:14,I have to admit that Bush's performance was much better tonight. The current zeitgeist against existing pols will hold him down for a while.
644330274260676611,2015-09-17 02:01:23,Trump: I'll get the homework done before I enter the Oval Office. Yeah. What happened the last time we elected a sparkling personality?
644324807203549184,2015-09-17 01:39:39,Another great oration from Carly.  https://t.co/cWoeT9judX

644319759463526400,2015-09-17 01:19:36,Trump is right about the need for assimilation. #CNNDebate
644317539699412993,2015-09-17 01:10:46,The screams in my house after Carly's counter to Trump@on her appearance were tantamount to those heard at the Mal Butler interception

644309720896045056,2015-09-17 00:39:42,Trump's solution to countering an aggressive Putin in Syria is to talk to him and be friends. Sounds a LOT like Obama's approach #CNNDebate
